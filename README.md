## Project Goals

Learn and apply the concepts of software engineering in a real project, using a methodology that allows the development of a software product in a team. The project was developed in the context of a course unit, in a group of 5 students.
There were 5 deliveries we called "iterations", in each one we planned a sprint focused on a specific set of user stories.

## Development Report

You can find here details about the product, from a high-level vision to low-level implementation decisions, a kind of Software Development Report, organized by discipline (as of Rational Unified Process):
- Business modeling
    * [Product Vision](docs/ProductVision.md)
    * [Elevator Pitch](docs/ElevatorPitch.md)
- Requirements
    * [User stories](https://github.com/FEUP-LEIC-ES-2022-23/2LEIC13T1/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22user+story%22)
    * [Domain model](docs/requirements.md)
- Architecture and Design
    * [Logical architecture](docs/ArchitectureAndDesign.md)
    * [Physical architecture](docs/ArchitectureAndDesign.md)
    * Vertical prototype
