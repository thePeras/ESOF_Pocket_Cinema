## Project Goals

Learn and apply the concepts of software engineering in a real project, using a methodology that allows the development of a software product in a team. The project was developed in the context of a course unit, in a group of 5 students.
There were 5 deliveries we called "iterations", in each one we planned a sprint focused on a specific set of user stories.

## Development Report

You can find here details about the product, from a high-level vision to low-level implementation decisions, a kind of Software Development Report, organized by discipline (as of Rational Unified Process):
